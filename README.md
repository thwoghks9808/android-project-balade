### GPS Location Service App Client

Balade means walk in French. The reason for this name is that I felt word Hiking or Climbing is kind of too heavy  
"Balade" is Location Tracking Service using GPS Signals and network location.  
you can check how much you walked or how long you've walked, share information with other users on Community Board and compare yourself tith other users through Ranks.  


this application was created for my final team project on 3 month education course.  
I was responsible for Android Delvelopment so server is not included in this repository
connection to server was done with Retrofit2 so if someone is willing to use this code, got to be careful on connection part
